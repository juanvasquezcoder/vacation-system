# vacation-system
My first JAVA program

I could not compile the program due to technical problems. 
I apologize for this inconvenience
however I leave you the step by step to run the application correctly.

PREREQUISITES

to have JAVA installed, if not I leave the direct link to the official web site, https://www.java.com/en/download/

1. Download the repository
2. Open CMD 
3. go to the folder where you downloaded the repository, for example ( cd C:\Users\User\Downloads\vacation-system)
4. write the following line of code ( java Welcome.java )

it is a very basic program with what I learned about java in 1 week.
